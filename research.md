Network science is interdisciplinary. Focusing on improving current analytical strategies, I try to
absorb influences of other disciplines to inform and improve understandings about human behaviors with applications in neuroscience, psychiatry, psychology and others. Broadly speaking, I
model real-world networks with statistically sound principles and methods—reduce network complexity, perform intuitive visualization and test critical hypotheses with improved statistical power
and controlled type I errors. I am particularly interested in the topological structures of networks
and the roles they play in (neuro)degeneration, (neuro)development and resilience.
