My primary research interest is to develop scalable statistical and computational approaches for high-dimensional biomedical data with a focus on network science, high dimensional data analysis, neuroimaging, data integration and statistical machine learning. I develop MRI analytic methods, Bayesian inference and latent space network models incorporating biological, psychological and medical information. I also have extensive experience in translational research, providing support on study design and analyses for studies investigating psychiatric outcomes, mental disorders, aging, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, etc."},{"location":"#news","title":"News:","text":"<p>(August, 2024) I will be presenting at a cross-core workshop hosted by Indiana Alzheimer's Disease Research Center.</p> <p>(August, 2024) I will be presenting our poster Sex-specific topological structure associated with dementia identified via latent space network analysis at Alzheimer's Association International Conference.  </p> <p>(July, 2024) The paper in collaboration with the Fredericks lab  has been accepted at the Biological Psychiatry: Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging. </p> <p>(July, 2024) I have started a tenure track Assistant Professor position at the Indiana University School of Medicine. </p> <p></p>"},{"location":"publications/","title":"Publications","text":"<p>See CV. </p> <p>Find additional information at GoogleScholar and ResearchGate. </p>"},{"location":"research/","title":"Research","text":"<p>Network science is interdisciplinary.
