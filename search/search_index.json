My primary research interest is to develop scalable statistical and computational approaches for high-dimensional biomedical data with a focus on network science, high dimensional data analysis, neuroimaging, data integration and statistical machine learning. I develop MRI analytic methods, Bayesian inference and latent space network models incorporating biological, psychological and medical information. I also have extensive experience in translational research, providing support on study design and analyses for studies investigating psychiatric outcomes, mental disorders, aging, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, etc.       <p></p>"},{"location":"#news","title":"News:","text":"<p>(November, 2024) New paper is published at Alzheimer's &amp; Dementia.  </p> <p>(November, 2024) Xinzhi's first-author preprint is out Cost efficiency of fMRI studies using resting-state vs task-based functional connectivity.

She received her undergraduate degree in Psychology from the University of Rochester (\u201821) and an M.S. degree in Biostatistics with a concentration in Statistical Bioinformatics from Northwestern University (\u201922). Her applied research background is in predictive models, causal inference, and survival analysis. In her free time, she enjoys jet skiing, kayaking, and spending time with her pet Leopard tortoise named Strawberry.  Theyanesh Jayaprakash Theyanesh is pursuing a Master\u2019s in data science from Indiana University Bloomington. Previously, he worked as a Senior Software Engineer at Optum, part of UnitedHealth Group, where he gained extensive experience in healthcare data analytics, focusing on data modeling, ETL processes, data warehousing, and visualization to create business-specific client reporting. As a Research Assistant, he is developing deep learning models to explore Alzheimer's disease, specifically analyzing atrophy patterns and disease progression. He aspires to contribute to mental health research and early cancer detection through sentiment analysis, emotion recognition, and anomaly detection.  Connor Cornelison Connor Cornelison is a first-year Data Science MS student at IU Bloomington, holding an undergraduate degree in Computer Science from Indiana University South Bend. He is currently researching sex-specific imaging biomarkers for Alzheimer's Disease, modeling using the ABC model. He plans to pursue a career in scientific computing, with a focus on AI-powered data processing."},{"location":"publications/","title":"Publications","text":"<p>See CV. </p> <p>Find additional information at GoogleScholar and ResearchGate. </p>"},{"location":"research/","title":"Research","text":"<p>Network science is interdisciplinary.
