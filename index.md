    I am a tenure track Assistant Professor in the Department of Biostatistics and Health Data Science, Indiana University School of Medicine. My primary research interest is to develop scalable statistical and computational approaches for high-dimensional biomedical data with a focus on network science, high dimensional data analysis, neuroimaging, data integration and statistical machine learning. I develop MRI analytic methods, Bayesian inference and latent space network models incorporating biological, psychological and medical information. I also have extensive experience in translational research, providing support on study design and analyses for studies investigating psychiatric outcomes, mental disorders, aging, Alzheimerâ€™s disease, etc.
